# fsTActl

**fsTActl** is a collection of LabVIEW programs for device control and data acquisition in femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy systems.

---

## Overview

The fsTActl package provides an integrated LabVIEW-based solution for instrument control, synchronization, and data acquisition in femtosecond transient absorption spectrometers. The codes are organized by experimental configuration and maintained in dedicated branches.

## Usage

1. Open the main LabVIEW control VI.
2. Configure device parameters according to your experimental requirements.
3. Initialize connected instruments and verify communication.
4. Start data acquisition and monitor system status in real time.
5. Save acquired data for subsequent processing and analysis.
